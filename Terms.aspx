   	<h3> Terms and Conditions</h3>	
	<hr class="soft"/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; <h5>1. Product details, prices &amp; delivery</h5> 
&nbsp;We make every effort to be as accurate as possible in the Product descriptions and prices. However, these may change due to circumstances beyond our control. Please note that prices on our website may vary from those in the RSC shops and that all items are offered subject to availability at the time of ordering. Please note that some products may be subject to specific terms and conditions. These will be detailed in the individual product description where applicable.
    &nbsp;We regret that we are unable to deliver certain Products to certain countries owing to import or customs restrictions. Any restrictions of this kind are noted on the relevant webpage in the Product details. 
    &nbsp;If you are under 18 years old, you may purchase Products only with the involvement of your parent or guardian. <br/>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<h5> 2. How the contract is formed between you and us</h5>
</p>
    <p>
&nbsp;After placing an order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order and confirming whether or not we can accept that order. The contract between us (Contract) will be formed when we send you an acknowledgement email which confirms our acceptance of your offer to purchase the Products. 3.2 The Contract will relate only to those Products indicated in the acknowledgement email. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until acceptance of your order for those Products has been confirmed in a separate acknowledgement email.</p>
<h5>&nbsp;3. Price &amp; payment </h5>
    <p>&nbsp;The price of any Products will be as quoted on our website (except in cases of obvious error) and prices include VAT but exclude delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due as listed on our delivery charges page. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you an acknowledgement email.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Our website contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our website may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product&#39;s correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product&#39;s correct price is higher than the price stated on our website, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you an acknowledgement email, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Payment for all Products must be by credit or debit card. We accept all major credit and debit cards, with the exception of Diners Club International and we will not charge your credit or debit card until we despatch your order. &nbsp;</p>
	<h5>&nbsp;4. Our refunds policy</h5>
    <br/>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Whilst we hope you will be delighted with your order, if for any reason you are not completely satisfied, we will be happy to offer a refund, exchange or replacement on Products returned to us within 30 days of receipt, provided that returned Products are in their original, unopened and unused condition. Your statutory rights are not affected. Instructions for return will be included with your order.
</p>
    <p>
&nbsp;When you return a Product to us because you have cancelled the Contract between us within the 14-day cooling-off period (see section 5.1 above), we will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the date you have given notice of your cancellation. In this case, we will refund the price of the Product in full, including the delivery charges for sending the item to you. However, you will be responsible for the cost of returning the item to us.
</p>
    <p>
        When you return a Product to us for any other reason, (for example because you claim that the Product is defective), we will examine the returned Product and will notify you of your refund via email within a reasonable period of time.
</p>
    <p>
&nbsp;We will usually process any refund due to you under section as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the date we confirmed to you via email that you were entitled to a refund for the defective Product. Products returned by you because of a defect will be refunded in full, including a refund of the delivery charges for sending the item to you and the postage cost incurred by you in returning the item to us.
</p>
    <p>
&nbsp;We will usually refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase. &nbsp;</p>
<h5>&nbsp;5. Our liability</h5>
    <p>&nbsp;We warrant to you that any Product purchased from us through our website is of satisfactory quality and reasonably fit for all the purposes for which products of its kind are commonly supplied. 
    Our liability to you (whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise) is limited to the purchase price of the Product you purchased. 
    &nbsp;We will not accept liability for any indirect, special or consequential losses, including (for example) loss of profits, revenue, contracts, data or goodwill. 
   &nbsp;These terms of use do not affect your statutory rights as a consumer. 
   &nbsp;Nothing in these terms limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for any other matter for which it would be illegal for us to limit, or attempt to limit, our liability.
