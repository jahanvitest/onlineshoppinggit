                Most stores will reject your order if the credit card number is wrong, or if your address does not match the address the credit card sends its bills to.<br />
At most stores, then, you must enter a billing address, and for many that must also be the shipping address, so they can be sure you are not a criminal who has stolen a card and wants stuff sent direct to a motel room.<br />
Sites specifically set up for gifts do allow you to have the present sent directly to the recipient, but that is unusual.

                At the end of checkout, you are asked whether you want to submit the order or clear the form. Submitting the order just means sending the order in officially, committing yourself to the purchase.

Generally, the system digests the order, checks with your credit card company, checks product availability, then comes back with a confirmation showing what you ordered, where it will be sent, and oh yes, what the order ID or confirmation number is.

Save this number.

If possible, print this confirmation page or save it on your hard disk, because this number is what you need to use to track your order or cancel.

                Do your part by printing out the form before you submit it, and then printing and saving the confirmation that should come up directly after you submit the order.

Good stores confirm a) on the screen, right after you send the order in, or b) by email, or c) both ways.

Once you see the confirmation, the order has been placed and you cannot easily change it. If you see a terrible mistake, look for a customer service number or email, and call or send a message right away. The faster you intervene, the more likely you can head off disaster.

The confirmation may be called a purchase verification, and you are sometimes asked, one more time, to confirm that you really, really want to place this order.

                You need to act quickly, because these places ship quickly, and once the product has been shipped you cannot completely cancel. You may be able to plan for a return, but you will often be dinged for shipping costs.

• Phone Customer Service, so you can talk with a real human.

• If no one answers for half an hour or so, send email to the Customer Service people, using the Contact Us email address.

You’ll be in luck if you ordered a product that is not in stock, because then the store has not shipped it and canceling is easy.

                Most sites that use secure servers are set up to take orders 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But if delivery times are crucial, order very early in the day, to be sure that the product can go out that day, or at slower stores, the next day. Wonder when their cutoff time is for shipments? Look on the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list, under shipping, to see when they process orders, or when the cutoff time is, after which your order goes out the next day.<br />

A few sites want to call you back to confirm the details of a messy or complex order, such as a two-week adventure in Mongolia. Some online stockbrokers are so suspicious that they insist on calling you just to make sure you are the one trying to set up the account. In these cases, your order is not really processed until a clerk calls you for confirmation during business hours.

                Some companies tell you, in every product description, exactly how many copies they have in stock, so you know in advance if something is currently available, out of stock, or back-ordered.<br />
But many stores do not tell you ahead of time whether the product is really available. This failure, often due to laziness or poor systems integration, can be a real nuisance, because these are the very stores that wait a week or so before grudgingly acknowledging that the product is not in stock. You have a legal right to cancel the order at that time, whether or not the store tells you so.
